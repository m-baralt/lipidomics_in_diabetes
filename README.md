# Lipidomics in diabetes mellitus

Code used to analyse and obtain the results in the paper: 

Barranco-Altirriba M. et al. Lipidome characterisation and sex-specific differences in type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Cardiovasc Diabetol. 2024 Mar 29;23(1):109. doi: 10.1186/s12933-024-02202-5. PMID: 38553758; PMCID: PMC10981308.

* The `Analysis.R` file contains the code that computes the p-values shown in the paper. It saves the results in the generated `Results` directory. The `dir_path` variable needs to be defined as the directory containing the data in line 12. The data will be available soon at MTBLS-

* The `Descriptive_stats.R` file contains the code to obtain the initial descriptive results.

* The `Results_paper.R` file contains the code to obtain the rest of the results. 

* The `Required_functions.R` file contains necessary functions for the rest of files. 

In the data directory, the clinical variables of the population are available.
